# AI-Assisted Phishing Awareness & Compliance Portal  
### GRC Workflow Automation Agent (Proof-of-Concept)

## High-Level Overview

This project is a **working prototype of an AI-assisted GRC workflow portal** designed to simulate how modern organizations manage security awareness training, employee compliance tracking, and audit-ready reporting.

While presented as a phishing awareness training system, the underlying objective is to demonstrate the design and implementation of an **AI-enabled GRC assistant** that reduces manual compliance workload and improves visibility into human risk across the organization.

This project is **modeled after real enterprise compliance workflows** and is built as a proof-of-concept for future **enterprise AI security copilots** that support GRC, security leadership, and audit teams.

## What This Portal Is Designed To Do

The portal simulates a centralized environment where organizations can:

- Deliver phishing awareness training  
- Track employee training completion and performance  
- Maintain compliance evidence for audits (SOX, ISO, SOC2 style scenarios)  
- Provide leadership with real-time compliance posture visibility  
- Reduce manual GRC tracking and reporting effort  

At its core, this system demonstrates how an **AI-driven GRC assistant** could sit on top of compliance workflows and help analysts focus on risk decisions instead of administrative tracking.

---

## How This Helps GRC Analysts

In many organizations, GRC analysts spend significant time:

- Tracking training completion manually  
- Building audit evidence packages  
- Answering repetitive compliance status questions  
- Aggregating data across multiple systems  
- Preparing executive reporting decks  

This portal demonstrates how an intelligent workflow system can:

### Reduce Manual Compliance Tracking
Automates training completion tracking and performance monitoring across employees and departments.

### Accelerate Audit Preparation
Maintains structured training evidence that can be used during audit cycles without manual data collection.

### Improve Risk Visibility
Provides centralized dashboards showing compliance posture and training effectiveness across the organization.

### Enable AI-Assisted Decision Support (Future Extension)
Architecture supports AI capabilities such as:
- Compliance trend summaries  
- Risk-based training recommendations  
- Executive-ready compliance insights  
- Analyst workflow prioritization

## AI Agent Concept Demonstrated

This project models the foundation of a **GRC Virtual Assistant** capable of:

- Interpreting employee training data  
- Summarizing compliance posture  
- Highlighting risk trends across departments  
- Supporting audit evidence generation  
- Providing leadership-level compliance insights  

The long-term vision is an AI layer that acts as a **copilot for GRC analysts**, reducing time spent on manual reporting and data normalization.

## Example Enterprise Use Case Scenarios

### Audit Preparation (SOX / ISO / SOC2 Style)

During an audit cycle, GRC teams must prove:

- Employees completed required training  
- Training effectiveness is measured  
- Evidence is timestamped and traceable  
- Compliance status can be reported at any time  

This portal demonstrates how compliance data can be continuously tracked and structured for audit readiness.

---

### Executive Compliance Reporting

Security and compliance leaders often need quick answers to questions such as:

- What percentage of employees are compliant today?  
- Which departments are highest risk?  
- Are training initiatives improving behavior?  

This system demonstrates how a centralized portal can provide leadership-ready compliance visibility without manual reporting preparation.

---

## Why This Project Matters

Modern GRC programs struggle with:

- Manual evidence collection  
- Spreadsheet-driven compliance tracking  
- Fragmented data across systems  
- Slow audit preparation cycles  
- Limited real-time visibility into human risk  

This project demonstrates how **automation + AI-ready architecture** can transform GRC from reactive reporting into proactive risk visibility.

## My Role in This Project

I designed and built this system end-to-end, including:

- Backend workflow logic  
- Frontend training and compliance portal  
- Data modeling for employee compliance tracking  
- Compliance workflow design based on enterprise patterns  
- AI integration architecture for future GRC copilot capabilities  

---

## Technology Stack (High Level)

- Node.js backend services  
- Web-based portal interface  
- Structured compliance data modeling  
- API-driven workflow architecture  
- AI-ready extension points for future intelligent automation  

---

## Important Note

This is a **demonstration prototype** designed to model enterprise GRC workflow automation concepts.  
It is not intended for production deployment and does not include production security controls such as encrypted credential storage or hardened authentication flows.

---

## Future Vision

This project is designed to evolve toward:

- AI-powered compliance copilots  
- Risk-based human behavior analytics  
- Automated audit evidence generation  
- Natural language compliance reporting for executives  
- Integration into broader GRC and vulnerability management ecosystems  

---

## Strategic Value

This project demonstrates my ability to build systems that sit at the intersection of:

- GRC workflow design  
- Security automation  
- AI-assisted compliance operations  
- Enterprise risk visibility
